## Assignment 1: Deeper Regression, Smarter Features
**Notebook:** C1M1_Assigment.ipynb  

This assignment focuses on multi-feature regression using neural networks. It includes loading data from a CSV file, normalizing inputs, engineering a new feature, building a multi-layer neural network, training the model, and predicting delivery time for unseen data.

## Assignment 2: EMNIST Letter Detective
**Notebook:** C1M2_Assigment.ipynb  

This assignment applies image classification techniques to the EMNIST Letters dataset. It covers data loading and preprocessing, building and training a neural network to classify handwritten letters, evaluating model performance, and decoding a handwritten message using the trained model.

## Assignment 3: Overcoming Overfitting – Building a Robust CNN
**Notebook:** C1M4_Assigment.ipynb  

This assignment improves an overfitting convolutional neural network by enhancing the data pipeline, introducing data augmentation, refactoring the model into modular CNN blocks, and applying regularization techniques such as batch normalization, dropout, and weight decay.

## Assignment 4: Plant Type Classification
**Notebook:** plants_type.ipynb  

This assignment focuses on classifying plant types from image data. It includes preprocessing images, building a convolutional neural network, training the model, and evaluating its performance on unseen plant images.
